Personal Statement,,,,
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________,,,,
"This is a write-up that explains why you wish to enter the Master of IT in Business programme, in",,,,
"what ways you believe you are qualified, and your future career aspirations.",,,,
Every Student who is passionate in getting a master?s degree would definitely strive in succeeding,,,,
that. They are students who really want to achieve something in their functional arena and move,,,,
"forward in structuring and fulfilling their aims in pursuing Masters, and I am one among them who",,,,
wants to grab hold on the best possible opportunity which falls in my way in getting a Master?s,,,,
Degree.,,,,
Obtaining First-Class with Distinction in my Bachelor?s degree in the field of Computer,,,,
Science & Engineering will always be a wonderful moment and something which I would cherish for a,,,,
very long time and I am happier and satisfied that it has helped me to grab hold on the fundamental,,,,
"concepts of Computer Programming with ease and creativity. I had various subjects like Java, Dotnet,",,,,
"Computer Architecture with SQL and many more. Amongst all, I was very much dragged and attracted",,,,
towards SQL and wanted to learn more of its complex query Structure and formation. I attended,,,,
"various workshops on Cloud Computing, Android App Development and an International Conference on",,,,
"Communication, Computing and Information Technology. I underwent implant training at Accel Frontline",,,,
Ltd and in BSNL during my second year at college which proved really helpful in interacting and,,,,
understanding their work culture and pattern and what they really do. My Final year project was an,,,,
interesting one. It was titled ?Implementation of College Management System Using Blackberry?. The,,,,
project deals with a Blackberry application which aims at providing good security and user,,,,
convenience. The app simplifies the student details and staff schedules in a more efficient manner.,,,,
"
Apart from my academics, I was very interested in Extra-curricular activities too, my skills at",,,,
playing carrom has earned me many prizes in many competitions. I have acquired Vedic knowledge and,,,,
learnt Upanishads procedurally and have chanted the same in many occasions. I had been an active,,,,
member in organizing and managing a cultural symposium named ?BIOS 2K13? in my college and feel this,,,,
"would enhance my ability to work as a team.
Soon after, I got an opportunity to step into a real",,,,
"precipitous world, as a Project Trainee at Ramco Systems. Here I got an exposure and opportunity to",,,,
learn about SQL Server Management and was a part of the Product Delivery Aviation Team which,,,,
supports various Aircraft Maintenance. Ramco Systems has established themselves as one of the finest,,,,
Enterprise Resource Planners on Cloud. My responsibility was to solve the defects raised in,,,,
accordance to satisfy the Screen development and Customer Specifications.,,,,
I always believed that I,,,,
had the potential to excel in the field of Computer Science and hold a Master?s degree. I was very,,,,
much inclined in choosing NUS for pursuing my masters as it provides quality education with a good,,,,
study atmosphere. Singapore as such is a wonderful place to live with its welcoming and Cultural,,,,
Society and has always been an increasingly popular study destination with international students,,,,
across the globe. The educational System in SMU is much organized and well standardized with highly,,,,
qualified staffs which increase the quality of education. If given an opportunity to be a part of,,,,
your prestigious university I would be really grateful and perform my tasks to the greatest of my,,,,
abilities.,,,,
