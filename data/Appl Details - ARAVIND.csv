Personal Statement
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
"This is a write-up that explains why you wish to enter the Master of IT in Business programme, in"
"what ways you believe you are qualified, and your future career aspirations."
"Right from my childhood, I have always had passion towards analytical subjects. I was more inclined"
"towards challenging subjects that needed analytical skill rather than memory power. So, over a"
period of time I discovered myself as confident person with a strong foundation in the basic
"concepts of mathematical subjects. 
During my undergraduate studies, I fared relatively better in"
subjects dealing with analytics and mathematical methods than the other courses. At the end of my
"undergraduate studies, I came to a clear conclusion that analytics is the field of my passion and I"
would like to develop my interest in this area by choosing it as a career.
During my project work
on the ?experimental investigations of cutting parameters influence on cutting force in turning of
"mild steel?, there was a lot of data and readings that had to be processed in order to obtain the"
"right results. The experimentation involved four parameters namely tool, speed, feed rate and depth"
of cut. There were three levels for each parameter. This meant that 81 experiments had to be
conducted in order to obtain the results. This is practically not feasible. Due to my sound
"knowledge on data optimization techniques, I opted for the Taguchi?s technique of orthogonal array"
using which the number of experiments was optimized to 9. The experiments were conducted and the
"results obtained were subjected to further analysis using Minitab software, which helped in"
determining the most influential parameter. This project work thus has made me quite accustomed to
using the Minitab software for various data processing requirements.
I was always meticulous from
my kindergarten days. I used to confirm with my sister many times that whether my home assignments
were properly done or not. This reflected in my studies too. Since analytical problems had a back
"step confirmation, I was more comfortable with these subjects. At one point, my confidence towards"
analytical papers boosted as higher than that towards theoretical papers. My interest in mathematics
"always lasted till I figured out the right approach to arrive at the solution, after which the"
problem turns out to be the usual stereotype. This has been a major problem for me because I tend to
"make mistakes at the end stage before arriving at solutions, which I am rectifying nowadays.
Being"
"a mechanical graduate, I am interested in technical aspects but later I found that pure technical"
was not my strongest suite. When I decided not to pursue with my masters in mechanical oriented
"subjects, I came across business analytics. The syllabus of this course compliments both my"
analytical and technical passion. I would like to start afresh in this field and outplay others.

Your institution is the perfect place for me to start in this field. The strong faculty and the
research facilities available at SMU are ideal and provide excellent support for a graduate student
"like myself to grow and learn. Considering all these aspects and my focus, determination and"
"academic interest, I believe that this course is the ideal one for me, where there are no"
"boundaries, paving a way in both the technical and analytical fields. Given the opportunity, I will"
do my best to make use of it and excel.
