Personal Statement,,,,

"This is a write-up that explains why you wish to enter the Master of IT in Business programme, in",,,,
"what ways you believe you are qualified, and your future career aspirations.",,,,
Life is the sum total of the choices one make. This simple quote has had a profound effect on my,,,,
life ever since I encountered it. I find it to be true that our lives span out in the direction,,,,
decided by our choices. This has made me realize the importance of making good decisions in life. I,,,,
have always had tact for making considered decisions and have strived to improve this ability at,,,,
"every opportunity. 
Since an early age, my focus has been on learning new things and experimenting",,,,
with my thoughts. School was my first source of knowledge and I showed particular interest toward,,,,
the sciences. During my secondary school education I secured 92 percent proving my potential as top,,,,
notch student with my first board exam. My drive towards learning different things made to choose,,,,
Computer Science as my base in Higher Secondary Education and once again excelled by securing 92,,,,
percent in my second board exam which paved me a pathway to get good knowledge in my under,,,,
"graduation.  Hence, when the time came to decide on my major field of study in college I favoured",,,,
"Engineering, Electrical & Communication Engineering in particular.
Initially I entered my college",,,,
with myself with a plan of excelling only in academics to maintain consistency from my schooling. My,,,,
college was the place which added more fuel to my desire where I had an opportunity to project,,,,
"myself as a good team player, leader and a perfect manager through various activities including",,,,
sports. ,,,,
Sports have been an important part of my life also. It helps me relax and I enjoy,,,,
"developing new tactics and game strategies. I was in my college team for Basketball, Volleyball and",,,,
Ball Badminton. I also served as Captain of the Basketball team.,,,,
Every time I do encourage myself,,,,
"such that in any area wherever we are, we should show our presence and should place a impeccable",,,,
place for our position so that we could make a history.  In accordance with my above thought my,,,,
final year of my college life created a lot of wonderful memories to me and I feel proud to share,,,,
the same here. It was my last year in my college of under graduation in my captaincy I won,,,,
"Basketball Intramurals held on 2012,which is a sports event held at my college level. 
Also in",,,,
academics my consistency has been maintained maintaining my CGPA as 8.51 and made proud of my,,,,
parents securing ?FIRST CLASS WITH DISTINCTION? in my undergraduate education. I have completed my,,,,
final year of graduation by developing an innovative project named ?Digital Security on Images,,,,
through wavelet transformation? where we have given security to data by watermarking on digital,,,,
images such that it is transformed from one end to another providing high security.,,,,
Coming to,,,,
extra-curricular activities I served as a ?Coordinator? in my technical symposium named,,,,
?SANKEETHIKA? and the challenging task that was given to me was to coordinate the events and I gave,,,,
my hundred percent commitment proving myself to get the symposium done successfully without any,,,,
hurdles. Any task which is well planned is half done and is a part of managing quality of a person,,,,
and my role in my college technical symposium taught me how to plan things effectively.,,,,
Due to my,,,,
various accolades of learning and willingness towards learning getting into a professional life was,,,,
not that tough task irrespective of the competition that prevails. ,,,,
I easily nailed through my on,,,,
campus placement and my decision to join Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) a leading software services,,,,
provider as my first job proved to be prudent. I was delighted by the variety of the tasks handled,,,,
"by the company. We had clients in diverse fields including banking, digital and print media, retail",,,,
and others. I was given an opportunity to work in Retail Domain. Working for TCS has helped me,,,,
"imbibe the nuances of all these different sectors of industry. However, my expertise is in the",,,,
retail field and I have been a part of the team handling merchandising operations of ?The Home,,,,
Depot? for a period of about two years. I joined the team as a System Engineer and worked in that,,,,
position for a year until I received an opportunity to use my knowledge of application development,,,,
in a managerial position. I was asked to manage a team of five members which was responsible for the,,,,
daily maintenance and upkeep of a part of the various systems used by TCS in it?s The Home Depot,,,,
operations. The task was incredibly challenging as the volume of data processed was immense and,,,,
required a cool and rational state of mind to prevent any untoward loss of data. I excelled at this,,,,
role and received various accolades from both my employer and client for my efforts. I was awarded,,,,
with ?Certificate of Excellence? from my client The Home Depot. Knowing my values TCS awarded me,,,,
with ?On the Spot Winner? for handling various tasks given by the organization in efficient way.,,,,
,,,,
This was my first experience professionally in a managerial role and this change served another,,,,
purpose as well. It illuminated a new career path which complemented my strengths very well vis a,,,,
vis management. I realize now that I am capable of analyzing and dissecting a contingency to find,,,,
"the root cause and determine a set of tasks aimed at dealing with several issues. Until now, my",,,,
education has been toward acquiring technical knowledge. I would like to supplement it with a strong,,,,
knowledge of managerial methodologies and tools. I envision myself possessing this knowledge two,,,,
years from now and joining a consultancy firm similar to my current employer.,,,,
I have been on the,,,,
lookout for courses that will aid me in acquiring these skills. I am impressed by the portfolio of,,,,
your Master of IT in Business Analytics program. The importance that you give to the strategy,,,,
"development in this course suits my career needs particularly well. Besides, having an opportunity",,,,
to improve my skill set I believe that learning from an international university will definitely,,,,
serve to improve my understanding about IT practises worldwide.,,,,
