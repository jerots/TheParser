Personal Statement,,,,

"This is a write-up that explains why you wish to enter the Master of IT in Business programme, in",,,,
"what ways you believe you are qualified, and your future career aspirations.",,,,
"Data is the new oil. In the world of increasing business complexity, analytics and data-driven",,,,
decision making are the game changers for all types of enterprises. My fascination for analytics,,,,
took root after attending the ?Business Analyst Experience Workshop? by IBM in my college. It was a,,,,
"highly interactive event highlighting the data explosion, the need for managing the data and",,,,
leveraging it for business intelligence to gain a competitive advantage. After completing my,,,,
"Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Anna University, I chose to pursue a",,,,
"career in analytics.

I joined Mu Sigma, largest pure play Decision Sciences Company, after going",,,,
through a very competitive selection process. Mu Sigma provides decision support services for more,,,,
"than 140 Fortune 500 clients, transforming the decision making process. Being a novice in analytics,",,,,
"I underwent an intense training program that included skills in Business, Math & Technology to get",,,,
an interdisciplinary perspective. I received hands on training in statistics & data manipulation,,,,
"tools like SAS, R. Along with this I was also trained in the art of problem solving that included",,,,
"problem formulation, hypothesis generation, representation, hypothesis validation, insight",,,,
"generation, story boarding, design thinking, client communication & thought leadership. I got a mock",,,,
project which involved solving a real time business problem under the guidance of my mentor. My,,,,
project was to identify the factors to calculate the risk associated with the insured. I was,,,,
"evaluated and graded based on the executive summary comprising the findings, insights &",,,,
"recommendations for that business problem. 

On successful completion of my training, I started my",,,,
work for the pricing analytics team of a large home improvement retailer as a Business Analyst.,,,,
"During this time, I got the opportunity to work closely and solve high impact business problems with",,,,
clients who hold key responsibilities in a Fortune 500 company. I generated several monthly reports,,,,
"that assisted my clients to understand their performance in terms of price changes, impact of cost &",,,,
"retail, helping them to take better decisions. I also worked on clustering analysis, which involved",,,,
"segmentation of similar stores together, enabling the retailer to migrate from National level",,,,
pricing to Market level pricing. This project was well appreciated and consumed by the business,,,,
stake holders. It created a positive impact of around $2 million in that fiscal year for that,,,,
"retailer.

After a year with pricing analytics team, I felt it was time to explore new",,,,
horizontals. So I joined COGS analytics team which closely works with the Vendor negotiation team of,,,,
the same retailer. I helped my clients in creating and automating a number of frameworks that aided,,,,
them in cutting down cost and improving their gross margin. I initiated a project to identify the,,,,
problematic subcategory and improve the bottom line of the organisation. I was also an integral part,,,,
of the team that worked on the attribute based cost exceptions project. The objective was to single,,,,
"out vendors who decided the cost of the products arbitrarily, rather than the attributes of the",,,,
product. We used simple linear regression to break down the cost of a product into various,,,,
components and assign value for each attribute. I got an impact award for this project after the,,,,
appreciations we received from the end users. I was also promoted as Senior Business Analyst and,,,,
"given a bigger responsibility of leading a team of 5 people.
In Jan 2015, with more than 2 years of",,,,
"experience in retails analytics, I moved to digital analytics, to work for a Fortune 100 financial",,,,
service organisation. I created business performance reports which to monitor the performance of,,,,
their websites and measure the impact of their marketing channels. I started involving myself in,,,,
Business development activities. I used to discuss with multiple stake holders of our client and,,,,
pitch in proof of concepts for new engagements along with the business development team. As a result,,,,
"this, we were able to successfully convert five prototype engagements to permanent engagements.
The",,,,
technical accomplishments I have had in the past three years includes usage of statistical & data,,,,
"manipulation tools like SAS,R & excel to create reports and Business Intelligence tools like",,,,
"tableau, D3 for creating visualizations and driving consumption. Data analytics is a very dynamic",,,,
field. So it becomes all the more important for me as an analytics professional to keep up with the,,,,
latest trends and diversify my knowledge in the field. With the ever growing volume of structured,,,,
"and unstructured data available today, I realized the significance of learning new software",,,,
applications and technologies to enhance my skills and evangelize new ideas. I want to specialize in,,,,
the field of Decision sciences through a structured course in Business Intelligence and Data,,,,
"Analytics to develop a systematic understanding of processes, operations, data and technology. I",,,,
believe Masters in IT ? Business (Analytics Track) course offered by SMU would help me in the,,,,
process of evolving from an analyst to a decision scientist. I want to work in an area that,,,,
diversifies my knowledge in analytics and helps me identify my true potential as an analytics,,,,
professional.,,,,
