Personal Statement,,,,
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________,,,,
"This is a write-up that explains why you wish to enter the Master of IT in Business programme, in",,,,
"what ways you believe you are qualified, and your future career aspirations.",,,,
"Firstly, this skill and knowledge that I have gained from a potential MASTER OF IT IN BUSINESS",,,,
education will be able to help me become a great catalyst to contribute to building a regional,,,,
dashboard & analytic insight for the current SME that I am working in. I will love to enable the,,,,
"company with a faster access to provide insight to our daily performance, productivity level across",,,,
"all internal business processes, and, scientifically - forecast and predict the likely trends of",,,,
these performances. ,,,,
,,,,
This is especially so when the company is currently implementing a regional,,,,
"roll-out for a new ERP system (for our offices China & Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia, especially) -",,,,
and building a regional business intelligence platform will be one of the outcome. ,,,,
,,,,
Being a,,,,
"project member in this regional project, my knowledge and skill from MASTER OF IT IN BUSINESS will",,,,
be an asset to the team.,,,,
,,,,
While product innovation is essential to the DNA of a company - I always,,,,
"believe that with globalization, innovation in supply chain/ logistic movement will be an added on",,,,
"advantage to any company. This is especially so for SME, whom want to excel in the global stage.",,,,
"With the experience from  MASTER OF IT IN BUSINESS, it will definitely provide me with more tools",,,,
"towards extracting essential data and information from various sources, and proposed & execute a",,,,
"better way to manage our supply chain - especially so in regional management of freight, supplier",,,,
"management, stock movement & replenishment.


Next, I always have a vision to be able to",,,,
"transform the traditional way of doing sales in SME, especially those in the sunset industry - such",,,,
"as construction etc. In a traditional SME, without a MNC parent - often; business is conducted",,,,
"through only personal network, relationship, and words of mouth. Also, many tried to make use of the",,,,
"social media platform, but yet to fully utilize the potential of social media. 

In the age of",,,,
"globalization, and improvement in technology - consumer behaviors are changing. Thus; I always see",,,,
"that there is a great opportunity for SME to transform the current business practice, to further",,,,
"strengthen our customer relationship, better customer segmentation, provide services and product",,,,
"that best suited for our customer service, and better after sales service. 

I see that this can",,,,
"be fulfill by the use of business analytic,  where we draw insights from various ICT tools such as",,,,
"customer relationship management software etc. As such, we have quicker information and access to",,,,
"identify the changes in the performance of each customer segments, the nature of the products that",,,,
"they are interested, and even forecast and propose the product that they may be keen on, in their",,,,
"next purchases etc. 

With my current role as a Senior Capability Development Executive in a SME,",,,,
I believe that this is the change & improvement that I can bring to the current SME that I am,,,,
"working in, and definitely - an education with MASTER OF IT IN BUSINESS will be able to help me to",,,,
be a great catalyst to bring about these transformation to the company. ,,,,
,,,,
With the above - I,,,,
believe that this will definitely help this SME to write many success stories in our business,,,,
"excellence journey. Being able to contribute to these successful stories, I hope that these",,,,
experience will be able to enable me to later on - be able to share & train other SMEs to be able to,,,,
enjoy similar fruits of success - through the case studies of our business excellence journey.,,,,
