Personal Statement,,,
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________,,,
"This is a write-up that explains why you wish to enter the Master of IT in Business programme, in",,,
"what ways you believe you are qualified, and your future career aspirations.",,,
"As I approach my career ?half-life?, I am confronted with two choices. One, continue to do what I am",,,
"doing on the generalist path or two, chalk the path to a more fulfilling career. So I decided to",,,
look at my past and connect the dots for insights about myself. I was looking to find those,,,
"experiences that had kept me fully engaged, kept me awake all night, and had driven me passionately",,,
"to fulfil the task. Some of those that I had listed included;

1.	In 1995 at Reliance Petroleum, a",,,
lead received during one my field visits got me all excited. It seemed I had stumbled on a new,,,
market for Kerosene fuel. It took me to a granite factory in a remote village near Ichalkaranji,,,
"(Western India). At the factory I watched the entire operation, worked out the fuel consumption and",,,
extrapolated the market for the fuel. I spent the night putting together a detailed technical paper,,,
and submitted it to my headquarters. Personally I was super thrilled with my effort. RPL?s President,,,
Mr. P Raghavendran called me the next day and lauded me on my leadership and the quality of the,,,
report.,,,
"2.	Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) the most anticipated organization was coming to B-School",,,
"campus for their recruitment drive. 1998 was a tough year, jobs were scarce and competition was high",,,
for the two openings. I spent the night before the D-day to collect ten year stock and financial,,,
"performance of M&M and their competition, analyzed and calculated the Earned Value. During the",,,
face-to-face interview I got an opportunity to present my analysis. The passion and effort landed me,,,
"the job.
3.	Closer to present, in 2013 at CSC, I was assisting my leadership to turnaround a report",,,
on America region account performance. I had self learnt the Tableau tool and found an opportunity,,,
to use it to draw insights and help visualize the Net Promoter Score (NetPS) performance in the,,,
"region. Overnight, I got the raw NetPS survey data massaged, drew visualizations and identified the",,,
top performing and non-performing factors. The visualizations gave good visibility to leadership and,,,
were highly appreciated.,,,
,,,
There were five attributes that I learnt about myself from this,,,
"self-evaluation, namely;
1.	Passion to source data and information
2.	Patience and comfort in",,,
handling data,,,
"3.	Eagerness to try something new to make sense from data",,,
"4.	Bring out my innovative",,,
"best when fully engaged
5.	Last but not the least, drew lot of self-satisfaction

These",,,
attributes drew me towards ?data and analytics? as the area I wanted to be involved in my career.,,,
,,,
"
My years in sales solution and Big Data & Analytics consulting practice, gave me the opportunity",,,
to closely work with sales teams and customers across regions. Some of the trends I saw included:,,,
,,,
"
1.	Customers are recognizing the importance of SMAC (Social, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud) for",,,
competitive differentiation,,,
"2.	Customers are undertaking application and infrastructure",,,
modernization programs to consolidate and modernize most of their legacy stack and free up cash for,,,
adopting SMAC initiatives,,,
"3.	Customers are connecting their customer facing applications with their",,,
operational/enterprise applications to gain insights from integrated data,,,
"4.	Analytics is amongst",,,
the top priorities for the CIO and business managers. More and more IT services vendors are bundling,,,
analytics as a value added offering along with traditional offering,,,
,,,
The underlying asset driving,,,
all this disruption and transformation is ?Data? and customers are racing ahead to harness this,,,
quickly. Data and analytics are spawning a new revolution similar to what Internet and web did in,,,
"2000. 
 
To be ready to manage the transformation, it meant I had to specialize and pick up next",,,
generation skills. I am fully convinced on the need for specialization and data/analytics as the,,,
area of choice. ,,,
,,,
Five key reasons that I believe SMU?s MITB programme is the right way ahead to,,,
"meet my career aspiration include:
1.	Opportunity to get exposed to analytics, domain and",,,
technology and experience how value gets built for business,,,
"2.	Be in Singapore- the hub of",,,
analytics in the region,,,
"3.	Access to SMU SIS labs and research centres for hands on application and",,,
experiments,,,
"4.	Industry attachment that provides a real time work experience while studying",,,
,,,
"5.	MITB seminars that allow to gain further insight and opportunity to network",,,
,,,
?Intellectuals,,,
solve problems. Geniuses prevent them.?- Albert Einstein,,,
,,,
My skills in managing data and applying,,,
analytical approaches gained during MITB coupled with the required intuition and innovation drawn,,,
from past experiences will help me approach and address customer problems differently. The approach,,,
"will be based on using insights to solution proactive fixes, so that problems do not occur or occur",,,
with managed risk. This would be a true ?Left Shift? approach in Lean Transformation.,,,
,,,
There are,,,
two challenges that I want to explore during my MITB programme. These are in the healthcare sector.,,,
,,,
"1.	?Empowering the population with information to manage their health decisions and providing",,,
"greater access to care when needed and at the right cost?. 
2.	?Draw insights from disparate data,",,,
"such as consumer demographics / consumption / behaviour, drug-allergy data, patient health data,",,,
"etc. to provide a holistic patient profile for health practitioner, thereby increasing accuracy in",,,
diagnosis and treatment with improved health outcomes?.  ,,,
,,,
I would like to undertake projects that,,,
"explore such challenges and which calls for an intersection of analytics, healthcare (provider,",,,
"payer, ancillary, life sciences and pharmaceuticals), integrated technology (social, mobile, cloud),",,,
public health and government. The access to use and experiment in SIS labs such as SMU-Alexandra,,,
"Health T-Lab, Living Analytics Research Centre, SMU-TCS iCity lab under the guidance of the faculty,",,,
and in collaboration with Industry experts and peers will provide the right ecosystem and,,,
opportunity.,,,
,,,
I would want to use my MITB programme to specialize in data and analytics and take,,,
steps towards making my next half-life count. To quote Albert Einstein:,,,
,,,
?Not Everything that can,,,
be counted counts; ,,,
And not Everything that counts can be counted?,,,
